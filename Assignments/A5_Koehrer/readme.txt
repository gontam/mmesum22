Submit a "A5_Lastname_Name" .py or .ipynb into your branch or repo on GitHub.
The research part can be documented in the code as comments, generated from the code as a .pdf or
submitted separately as a report in the .pdf format.

1. Research:
    – choose and gather information about an infection or a virus
    - gather information about a population where an outbreak has occurred or could happen
            – identify a reliable source for health information for that region
            - choose a time frame (in days) for the model and/or the forecast
            - depending on the selected infectious disease, what compartments are there in the population?
    - define the factors that influence an outbreak either by using credible sources or by providing them
      by yourself with justification
            - primarily: susceptibility, infection rate, immunity
    - define the interventions that could have been/were undertaken to control the outbreak
        - how did you define the intervention factors in the equations? what are the values based on?
    - determine which variables are available and can be used to model this event
    - What is R0? How is it different to Re? Note the answer down.

2. Based on the data, create 2 scenarios and model:
    – an outbreak in a population
              -  plot a graph showing the values for each compartment over time
    – an outbreak with introduction of an intervention in a population
              -  plot a graph showing the values for each compartment over time
              - you can introduce 1 or more interventions
              - how did you choose the rates for the interventions?

3. Analysis:
    – analyze the impact of the intervention by comparing the scenarios without intervention vs scenario(s)
      with intervention(s):
             - create report to present your research data
             - write a short description of the scenarios with justification for the values used in the equations
             - write a short analysis of the scenarios you provide
             - compare both scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention
