Deadline 05.06.2022.
In groups (max 2), implement a cellular automaton according to the rules of Conway's Game of Life.
The rules can be found here: http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~lipa/mec/lesson6.html
- Choose visualization methods.
- How will each state of a cell be represented?
        - console -> special characters (space, *, ^, /, etc)
        - ...
- Set initial conditions (game field dimensions, initial configuration).
        - Ensure that the initial conditions set will result in patterns evolving at least up to the 100th generation.
- Prompt the user to provide the number of generations to be simulated.
- Define the rules.
Push to GitHub repo only the .py file with the title 'assignment_7_lastname.py'.
Libraries that implement cellular automata functionality cannot be used.
