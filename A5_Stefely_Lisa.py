#Assignment 5

#Research: choose and gather information about an infection or a virus
#    - gather information about a population where an outbreak has occurred or could happen
#            â€“ identify a reliable source for health information for that region
#            - choose a time frame (in days) for the model and/or the forecast
#            - depending on the selected infectious disease, what compartments are there in the population?
#    - define the factors that influence an outbreak either by using credible sources or by providing them by yourself with justification
#            - primarily: susceptibility, infection rate, immunity
#    - define the interventions that could have been/were undertaken to control the outbreak
#        - how did you define the intervention factors in the equations? what are the values based on?
#    - determine which variables are available and can be used to model this event
#    - What is R0? How is it different to Re? Note the answer down.

# The chosen disease is Covid-19
# I gathered information on how this is modelled, but did not choose a specific population, but rather played with the
# capacities of the model
# and the ranges of numbers in which the parameters alpha, beta, gamma and epsilon usually occur
# As this is covid, the SIER (and including Deaths) model was implemented based on the SIR model of Prof. Gonta

#as a source this website was used, where the specific steps are explained
# https://towardsdatascience.com/forecasting-the-covid-19-trend-using-the-seir-model-90979abb9e64
# but with Python instead of Java

# as an intervention a vacination was chosen
# the difference between R0 and Re is that Re ist the effective reproduction number, meaning how many people in the
# population can be infected by an individual at any specific time -> how many people are immuninized?


#example
# small village with 2000 people, after first infections full lockdown
